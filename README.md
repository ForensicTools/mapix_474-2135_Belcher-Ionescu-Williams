mapix
=====

Visualization tool to scan image files for time, GPS, camera data and plot on interactive map as thumbnails with timeline scrubbing.

Usage
-----
An internet connection is required for usage of this tool. 

Use the "Import" button to bring up a file system browser and select the folder containing the photos you wish to map - at this time, you can only select an entire folder (directory) and the folder must only contain image files. 

Once selected, the list under the import button will populate with the imported filenames in date/time order. The names can be clicked to view a scaled version of the photo. 

Once the photos are imported, the ticks on the timeline slider at the bottom will adjust so that there is one tick mark per photo. Drag the slider in either direction to plot photo thumbnails on the map in relation to the date/time they were taken.
